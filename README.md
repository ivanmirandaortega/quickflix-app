# QuickFlix

## About The App
#### QuickFlix is an app that brings the best movies of Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to one place. The user can search through all three libraries simultaneously, cutting their search time in half!
#### Our goal is to reduce the amount of time spent on deciding what to watch and instead enjoy your entertainment.
#### The user will log into their account and the full movie library will be shown. The user can search by movie genre, and platform and can also add to their own private favorites folder. In addition to viewing movies, users are also able to add comments and reviews to the movies they have watched.
